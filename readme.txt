Simply add a before / after image to any WordPress website.

== Description ==

With this plugin, you can display two similar images in one frame with a bar in the middle. So visitors can see the difference by moving the bar from left to right. Typical usecase is, when you want to show a "before-after" state with two images.

The shortcode: `[surbma-before-after before_src="" before_alt="" after_src="" after_alt="" with="" height=""]`

Parameters:

- before_src: This is the URL of the left image. REQUIRED
- before_alt: This is the ALT attribute of the left image.
- after_src: This is the URL of the right image. REQUIRED
- after_alt: This is the ALT attribute of the right image.
- with: This is the width of the image.
- height: This is the height of the image.

Only the two src parameters are required, the rest of them are optional.
